This repo tries to showcase a bug that affects SVGs pictures with color filters.

Sometimes they look great, but sometimes not. I feel it's something related to the Flutter renderer, that doesn't behave the same way on `html`, but I'm not 100% sure because I can't always reproduce the issue.

The project is deployed on CodeMagic so you can see how it behaves right now: https://svg-color-issue-example-flutter.codemagic.app/
